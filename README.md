# IoT Energy Monitoring Solution - Framework Documentation

Solution Overview
XYZ Limited requires a cost-effective, secure, and real-time AWS-native solution to monitor energy consumption using IoT devices. This solution captures real-time energy data from IoT-connected smart meters, processes it efficiently, and provides insights through analytics.

Architecture Components
1. IoT Device (Energy Metering Box): Measures energy consumption and transmits data via MQTT.
2. AWS IoT Core: Acts as a gateway for secure device communication.
3. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose: Streams real-time data from IoT Core to S3.
4. Amazon S3: Stores raw data in an optimized format (e.g., Parquet) for cost-effective analytics.
5. AWS Glue: Processes and transforms data for querying.
6. Amazon Athena: Enables querying of processed data.
7. Amazon QuickSight: Provides visual dashboards for monitoring.
8. AWS IAM & KMS: Ensures encryption and access control.

Implementation Details
1. Data Ingestion: IoT devices send energy readings to AWS IoT Core.
2. Data Streaming: IoT Core pushes data to Kinesis Firehose.
3. Data Storage: Firehose delivers data to an S3 bucket for long-term storage.
4. Data Processing: AWS Glue processes data, converting it into structured formats.
5. Analytics:
   - Athena queries processed data.
   - QuickSight visualizes trends and insights.

Security Measures
- Encryption in Transit: IoT Core enforces TLS encryption.
- Encryption at Rest: KMS encrypts stored data in S3.
- IAM Roles: Grant minimal permissions to AWS services.

Cost Optimization
- Serverless Architecture: Uses managed services (IoT Core, Firehose, Athena, QuickSight) to eliminate overhead.
- Data Format Optimization: Stores data in Parquet format to reduce storage and query costs.
- Automated Data Processing: Glue crawlers trigger processing workflows only when needed.

Scalability and High Availability
- AWS services are fully managed and scale automatically.
- Multi-AZ support ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

Bonus: Data Batching Optimization
Instead of sending individual IoT messages, the solution batches multiple readings before streaming them via Firehose. This reduces API costs and improves processing efficiency.

Conclusion
This architecture ensures real-time, cost-effective, and secure monitoring of energy consumption while maintaining high availability and low latency. It leverages AWS-native services to create a scalable and automated data pipeline.
